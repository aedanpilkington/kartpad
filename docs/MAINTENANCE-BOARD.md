# Maintenance work and test board

Snapshot: 12 September 2026. Current GitHub refresh: 42 open issues. Start at the
[support-agent hub](SUPPORT-AGENTS.md). The [priority source](maintenance-priorities.json)
owns ordering, readiness, exact next actions and acceptance; this board records
support decisions and evidence. Refresh GitHub and local ownership before acting.
The [device matrix](COMPATIBILITY-MATRIX.md) preserves target-specific observations.

## Current priorities and handoffs

Counts below are distinct non-maintainer issue authors at this snapshot, excluding
comment-only corroboration. Known duplicates #209/#210 collapse under #208. Families
overlap, so these numbers cannot be summed into total affected users. The selector
refreshes counts in its generated local context, not by automatically promoting
popular reports. Historical work and old requests remain in the
[previous board](https://github.com/chrissotraidis/kartpad/blob/2028ab3/docs/MAINTENANCE-BOARD.md);
the next actions below supersede those dated assignments.

| Priority / card | Issues / authors | Current decision and next actor |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 / `retro-save-loss` | #169 / 1 | `awaiting-reporter`: classify lost progress and ordinary exit versus pack replacement from the existing request. Do not deliberately lose more data. |
| 1 / `android-exits` | #143, #200, #205, #208–210, #128, #131, #207 / 7 | `awaiting-reporter`: one matching exit classification per distinct launch/cup/race subcase. #208 is canonical for #209/#210; similar wording does not establish a common runtime defect. |
| 1 / `ios27-startup` | #196 / 1 | `awaiting-owner`: signing/release operator prepares a clean, uniquely versioned corrected candidate; matching iPhone 17 Pro Max/iOS 27 tester accepts launch, race and relaunch in both profiles. Reuse completed simulator results. |
| 2 / `android-online` | #123, #206 / 2 | `awaiting-owner`: Pixel owner captures the session-entry-reserved trace through VS lobby-to-race and re-entry. Separate #206's four/five-race endurance failure; no timeout patch from an ambiguous trace. |
| 3 / `adreno-geometry` | #102, #104, #120, #137, #166, #193, #211 / 7 | `awaiting-owner`: release operator and affected-device tester establish compatible signing/delivery for the retained dynamic/literal/dynamic character-draw comparison. No GPU-wide cause or correction is established. |
| 4 / `warmed-performance` | #198, #167, #103, #169, #195, #204, #207, #135 / 8 | `awaiting-owner`: #198 tester is willing. The prepared profiler needs compatible signing or an approved data-preserving route **and** private delivery before capture. Retained Debug-signed APK is not a public-app in-place upgrade. |

These are checkpoints, not verified fixes. Finish available preparation before
parking work. If one of these owner actions becomes locally executable, update
that card to `ready-local`; an owner label alone is not a permanent external block.
If all remain blocked, choose genuinely ready known work below and add a bounded
card rather than repeating passing tests or an unanswered request.

## Evidence and outstanding requests

Use the [hub's request fields](SUPPORT-AGENTS.md#send-a-concrete-build-test-handoff)
when creating/updating a handoff. A request is not evidence that a test started.

| Request / evidence | Disposition and next gate |
| --- | --- |
| [#196 published build audit](https://github.com/chrissotraidis/kartpad/issues/196#issuecomment-5642179928) and [simulator result](https://github.com/chrissotraidis/kartpad/issues/196#issuecomment-5640549937) | Public v0.4.16-ios.2/build 36 still contains the reported aggregate-shard load. Corrected private simulator passes are sufficient to advance candidate preparation, not to close the iOS 27 device failure. Matching signed hardware test remains unperformed. |
| [#123 physical disconnect](https://github.com/chrissotraidis/kartpad/issues/123#issuecomment-5641278791) and [trace correction](https://github.com/chrissotraidis/kartpad/issues/123#issuecomment-5641572501) | Character/preparing-race disconnect is reproduced while the process stays alive. Old code-74 `recv_error` labels are invalid for attribution. Local follow-up requires a corrected, freshly prepared native trace with budget retained through session entry; existing login/dashboard results do not accept race/results/reconnect. |
| [#206 cellular/Wi-Fi comparison](https://github.com/chrissotraidis/kartpad/issues/206#issuecomment-5642749400) | `awaiting-reporter`: [acknowledgement posted](https://github.com/chrissotraidis/kartpad/issues/206#issuecomment-5642834780). On Samsung SM-S921W / Android 14 / build 65, mobile data worked once while Wi-Fi reportedly works normally. This is sufficient to isolate a network-dependent subcase; it does not prove a NAT, carrier or guest-runtime cause. Keep it separate from #123. Await the already requested confirmation that Wi-Fi passes beyond the prior four/five-race window before claiming a stable workaround; do not repeat the acknowledgement, known build/device questions or generic log request. |
| [#211 Retro screenshot response](https://github.com/chrissotraidis/kartpad/issues/211#issuecomment-5642589742) | `needs-one-detail`: Galaxy S24 Ultra and corruption in both profiles are supplied. Current in-app build and official pack version remain requested. Do not ask the handset again or infer GPU/driver. |
| [#166 additional device request](https://github.com/chrissotraidis/kartpad/issues/166#issuecomment-5628217442) | `requested`: exact device/build/profile and available renderer lines for the added report. Existing synthetic checks do not clear the failing gameplay draw. No duplicate probe/request. |
| [#198 willingness](https://github.com/chrissotraidis/kartpad/issues/198#issuecomment-5640922655) | `preparing`: existing warmed evidence justifies a bounded function profile. Signer compatibility/data preservation and private delivery are maintainer dependencies. Do not re-ask willingness, attach the APK publicly or represent installation/testing as started. |
| [#167 completed comparison](https://github.com/chrissotraidis/kartpad/issues/167#issuecomment-5608282606) | Supplied Infinix Hot 60 Pro / Android 16 / KartPad 0.4.11 / Original details and unchanged 1x aspect comparison are sufficient to stop that settings sweep. A selected warmed profile is a different decision; don't ask for the same device/build again. |
| [#208 canonical launch report](https://github.com/chrissotraidis/kartpad/issues/208) | `requested`: chooser versus Android home, profile/import state and matching exit result; #209/#210 do not justify new requests or three engineering assignments. |

Private artifact identities, symbols and handoff process references remain in the
ignored local maintenance checkpoint. Before delivering or installing, recheck the
actual retained file, source, signer and authorization; old prose is not provenance.

## Other issue families

These reports remain tracked even when outside the six leading work cards. Read
current comments and the linked source scope before promoting one into active work.

| Family | Reports / bounded next decision |
| --- | --- |
| Retro installation/version | #192 download/import and #194 updater design. Verify current app/official pack and last completed step; separate executable compatibility from a request for automatic updates. |
| Input/system UI | #119 bars, #184 mapping, #197 menu input, #202 aspect/display. Match physical/touch and chooser/gameplay paths; no renderer patch for an unclassified button/inset report. #184 has a bounded feature scope in [future features](FUTURE-FEATURES.md#android-d-pad-and-shoulder-remapping). |
| External display | #100 and #199. Match local-only, wired and AirPlay transitions/recovery separately. Existing Metal/source checks are not affected-display acceptance. |
| Apple controls/projection/multiplayer | #5, #91, #101, #127; open PRs [#112](https://github.com/chrissotraidis/kartpad/pull/112) and [#157](https://github.com/chrissotraidis/kartpad/pull/157). Reconcile current heads, candidate ownership and exact controller/split-screen scene before another build. |
| Apple performance | #135. A10X startup is already accepted; remaining frame-rate concern needs its own affected-device comparison, separate from Android CPU/GPU hypotheses. |
| Save/rating lifecycle | #105 manual transfer is accepted; automatic two-way sync and Mii scope remain distinct. #169 lost progress must be classified separately from performance and system bars. |
| Feature/compatibility | #90 Original Wiimmfi, #91 controller/DSU, #203 disc revision/NAND/cheats. Define requested behavior, supported input and implementation boundary; do not request generic logs for missing features. |
| Governance | #92 remains an upstream review dependency; do not create recurring runtime work from it. |

## Preserve accepted subscopes

- [#188](https://github.com/chrissotraidis/kartpad/issues/188#issuecomment-5633416311)
  is closed after reporter-confirmed Mii import on v0.4.16-android.1 / AYN Thor in
  Original and Retro. It is not waiting for another initial import request.
- [#135](https://github.com/chrissotraidis/kartpad/issues/135#issuecomment-5599088464)
  confirms the A10X startup correction; roughly 30–35 FPS remains a separate concern.
- [#105](https://github.com/chrissotraidis/kartpad/issues/105#issuecomment-5597997983)
  confirms manual save/rating transfer. Automatic synchronization is not implemented.

For every update, distinguish source corrected, candidate, host/simulator,
physical/reporter acceptance and release. Commit reviewed public queue changes
in the maintenance loop; no status-page edit establishes that a build is stable.
